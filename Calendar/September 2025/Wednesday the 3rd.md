### What makes a creative group work well together? 
I think the most crucial part of what makes a creative group work well together, is the desire & passion for the work. If no one is interested and passionate about working together and making a project come to life, they won’t be able to work well together. In addition to this I think it’s important for the members of the group to be of similar age/generation as this tends to have members being of the same culture and being able to connect easier. I also think in order for a creative project to be brought to life, the members need to have similar weight in the decision of what the work/project they’ll be doing will be.
