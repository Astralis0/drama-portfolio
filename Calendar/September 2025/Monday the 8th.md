### What is improvisation?
Improvisation is engaging in an activity that is not preplanned or prepared. There is spontaneity and freedom in the approach, allowing the activity to develop naturally without constraints.

### What opportunity did I have to be creative with my class today?
I was able to be creative in my approach to my work in class, particularly in the bit of adding sentences of the internal monologue to our Still Scenes from the previous class.

### What did I learn about myself?
I learned that I know a lot more that I previously realised and that I am not as bad as I thought I was with coming up with dialogue.

### Can I change anything for the next class?
I can try to retain everything I’ve learned and pay closer attention to the show that we’ll be attending on [[Monday the 15th]], next week.
