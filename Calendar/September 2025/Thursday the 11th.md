### Monologue for stage plan
(The aforementioned stage plan can be found in my Physical Portfolio, or alternatively [[here]])

C1: “This idiot has no idea what’s coming to him. I’m gonna blow his stupid little head off. Why couldn’t he have just stuck to the plan, everything would’ve been fine, but noooo, he had to get greedy, well he knew what the boss said."
C1, in a kind of high and mighty mock voice: 'He said 'Go in and bring back the boy and the girl unharmed' and yet here lies the boy, dead on the floor. And it’s not like we can just get rid of him now. Oh what am I do to now."
