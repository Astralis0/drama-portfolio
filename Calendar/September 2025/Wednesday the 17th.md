### Show Reflection
Into The Woods by James Lopine, in my opinion is a fantastic show and needs to be watched/attended. The production that we attended in Gorey Little Theatre is no exception to that, the amazing team of set designers, actors, costume designers, musicians and make-up artists did a brilliant job at bringing this show to life. And it could even be seen by a blind man, that an incredible amount of love, care, time and effort went into this production.

Now we only saw the dress rehearsal of act 1
